        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Diana (she/her) and I am a graduate from Clemson University, where I studied biochemistry. 
          As a recipient of the NIH Undergraduate Scholarship Fellowship, I spent 2 years after graduation at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Here, I spent the first year using imaging and molecular biology techniques to investigate the function of two proteins implicated in Parkinson's Disease and ALS/FTD. My work on this project has led to three publications, one as primary author and two as contributing authors. During my second year at the NIH, I then worked on using machine learning algorithms to analyze metabolic data from a cohort of 400 African American patients. The purpose here was to identify novel cardiovascular disease markers and metabolic profiles. With this project, I developed an aptitude for coding having to analyze these datasets and getting introduced to programming by having to learn to use R and Python.
        </p>
        To develop a stronger foundation in computer programming, I decided to do Ada Developer's Academy. I have an interest in full-stack or data science/database projects that help people/society on a large scale. Outside of coding, I am learning to mountaineer and ski and enjoy photography, hiking, running, and cycling.
